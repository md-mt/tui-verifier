# TUI Verifier

TUI Verifier is an evidence-first verification harness for terminal and TUI
applications. It launches a target command in a PTY, drives it with recipe
steps, records an asciinema v2 cast, derives a terminal screenshot from the
cast, optionally renders a 60-fps MP4 video with `agg` plus `ffmpeg`, and
writes a compact report.

The initial showcase recipes target the Pi coding agent because Pi is a real
terminal coding assistant with a stable local CLI surface.

## Quickstart

```bash
uv run tui-verify run examples/pi_help.recipe.json --video
uv run tui-verify run examples/pi_version.recipe.json --video
uv run tui-verify run examples/pi_list.recipe.json --video
uv run tui-verify run examples --priority P0 --renderer all --video
uv run tui-verify run examples/pi_codex_operator.recipe.json --video
uv run tui-verify list examples --priority P0
```

Each run writes artifacts under `.tui-verifier/runs/<run-id>/`:

- `session.cast` - asciinema v2 terminal recording
- `final.svg` - final terminal screenshot derived by replaying the cast
- `final.txt` - final terminal screen text
- `steps/` - per-step terminal screenshots and text snapshots
- `session.mp4` - 60-fps H.264 video rendered with `agg` plus `ffmpeg`
- `result.json` - machine-readable verdict and artifact paths
- `report.md` - review-friendly summary
- `latest-report.md` - aggregate report when multiple recipes/renderers run

Tracked Pi sample artifacts are included under `examples/artifacts/`.

`examples/pi_codex_operator.recipe.json` demonstrates agent-driven execution
with `codex exec` as the operator. The operator returns JSON assertions and a
transcript; the verifier still owns evidence generation from the transcript:
asciinema cast, screenshots, MP4 video, result JSON, and reports. In local Meta
launcher environments where `codex exec` exits before running because
`sandbox-exec` cannot apply its profile, the failed operator launch is captured
as normal verification evidence.

## Stack Design

The harness follows the same architecture as the MetaCode TUI validation stack:

- recipe metadata: `priority`, `execution`, `determinism`, `checks`, `ci_paths`
- recipe discovery and selection from `*.recipe.json` files
- renderer expansion with `--renderer default|all|<name>`
- per-run build provenance in aggregate reports
- evidence-first artifacts: cast, screenshot, per-step screenshots, MP4 video,
  result JSON, report
- agent-driven execution with a Codex CLI operator adapter
- before/after delta primitives for guardrail-style comparisons

## Recipe Format

Recipes are JSON files so they can live beside any project without importing
Python code.

```json
{
  "name": "hello-terminal",
  "priority": "P0",
  "execution": "scripted",
  "determinism": "deterministic",
  "checks": ["terminal prints hello"],
  "renderers": { "default": [] },
  "command": { "argv": ["python3", "-c", "print('hello tui')"], "pty": true },
  "steps": [
    { "action": "wait_for_text", "text": "hello tui", "timeout_seconds": 5 }
  ],
  "assertions": [
    { "type": "output_contains", "value": "hello tui" }
  ],
  "expect_exit_code": 0
}
```

Supported step actions:

- `wait_for_text`
- `wait_for_idle`
- `send_text`
- `send_line`
- `press`
- `sleep`

Supported assertions:

- `output_contains`
- `output_not_contains`
- `screen_contains`
- `screen_not_contains`
- `exit_code`
- `file_exists`
- `file_contains`

`command.pty` defaults to `true` for interactive TUI coverage. Set it to
`false` for terminal commands that should be captured without an interactive
PTY, while still producing asciinema-derived evidence.

`renderers` maps renderer names to extra argv appended to the command. For a
TUI with two frontends, a recipe can declare `{"opentui": [], "ink": ["-x",
"ink"]}` and `--renderer all` will run both.

The Pi examples do not assert a fixed exit code because Meta launcher sandbox
policy differs by machine. The actual exit code is still recorded in
`result.json` and `report.md`.

For agent-driven recipes, set `"execution": "agent-driven"` and add an
`operator` block such as `{"command": ["codex", "exec"], "prompt_mode":
"stdin"}`. The prompt includes the recipe checks, target command, terminal
dimensions, and expected JSON response schema.

## Why Asciinema First

The cast is the source of truth. Screenshots and videos are generated from the
same terminal recording that the verifier used for assertions, so reviewers can
inspect what happened instead of trusting a private terminal session.

This mirrors the product-validation direction from the MetaCode TUI validation
docs: drive the real terminal surface, assert product outcomes, and publish
reviewable evidence.
